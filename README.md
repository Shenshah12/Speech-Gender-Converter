# Speech-Gender-Converter

## Introduction
The Speech-Gender-Converter project is a MATLAB-based implementation that identifies the gender of a speaker from live-recorded speech. The system captures live audio through a microphone, processes it, and classifies the speaker's gender based on voice pitch and frequency.

## Features
1. Real-time voice recording for gender detection.
2. Live analysis without the need for pre-recorded audio files.
3. Visual representation of audio features such as frequency and pitch.

## Workflow
### Record Audio: 
The system captures voice using a connected microphone.

### Preprocessing: 
The captured voice is processed to clean the signal and extract features such as pitch and frequency.
### Gender Classification: 
Using the extracted features, the system classifies the speaker's gender (Male/Female).
